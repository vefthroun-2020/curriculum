          <p>
            Web Development is a projectdriven education that ends with a
            90 or 120 credits diploma on the 5th level of the EQF
            (or 4th level of the IQF). The goal is that students should be able to
            work in the branch by the end of the studies.
          </p>
          <p>The line is divided into 8 projects:</p>

          <h2>Introductory Course - 3 weeks</h2>
          <p>
            Introduction to various techniques on personal and group development,
            leadership, web development and presentation which will support the
            continuation of all other projects in the program. To showcase and
            experiment with all of these, a simple web page is created using basic
            design techniques, HTML, CSS and code management tools.

          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Explore the field - 1 week</h2>
          <p>
            This is a research project on the industry of web development.
            What is the scope of the work of a web developer?  What kind of job
            titles are under the umbrella-term web developer? The students will
            research their topics of interest and do a small project in that area.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>The fundamentals - 6 weeks</h2>
          <p>
            The students learn about the fundamental aspects of Javascript programming
            and create their first full-fledged web applications. The previously
            acquired knowledge on CSS is incremented with the use of CSS pre-processing,
            new design techniques are introduced and accessibility is integrated into the workflow.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Development tools, and advanced design - 7 weeks</h2>
          <p>
            More in-depth concepts in development such as programming paradigms,
             debugging, prototyping and interoperability are introduced,
             while growing a robust technical vocabulary. At the same time
             the students learn to create their designs having the user in
             mind (UX) to make sure their systems are not only functional but
             also highly usable, accessible and aesthetically pleasing.

          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Back-end - 5 weeks</h2>
          <p>
            In this project the students will get in touch with the back-end
            side of web development, create and understand CMS systems, code a
            REST API in PHP and Node.js, make use of databases such as MySQL,
            learn about hosting/DNS, among other activities.
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Mobile/Web App - 7 weeks</h2>
          <p>
            After building a solid base on all the most important topics on web
            development it is time for the students to explore their skills in
            a deeper level by creating a mobile/web app with React Native.
            All of the previously acquired soft skills come into play creating
            the ideal environment for effective teamwork and a solid final product.

          <h2>Further exploration - 4 weeks</h2>
          <p>
            Because the world of web development is ever-changing and evolving,
            it is important to be able to explore and learn its possibilities in
            order to stay relevant as a professional. The students are exposed to
            multiple topics such as animation, 3d, virtual reality, etc in order
            to widen their view over common web development.
          </p>
