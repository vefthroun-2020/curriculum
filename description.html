There are no special technical skills required for the program, we will guide you through all you need to know. Nonetheless, it is very helpful to be ready to do a good amount of self-learning and to be comfortable with group work</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This diploma program uses a project-based approach. It&rsquo;s divided into</span><span>&nbsp;Modules, each consisting of a few Learning Guides and one Group project. The</span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://io.tskoli.dev/guides&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1619173706687000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0cpTPapGHgJ3Pmw7iUcFlh">&nbsp;~40 guides</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;are individual projects that you develop to gain skills and knowledge on the topic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>During this study, students book lots of one-on-one meetings with instructors, which is where the big learning happens</span><span class="c3">. We take a look at what you&#39;ve been up to, help solve problems and point ways things could be done better. This is a hands-on course, most of the time is used for creating things. There are few classes aside from live coding sessions and workshops with guest teachers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The assignments you return using the guides are reviewed by your peers and you also review your peers&rsquo; work. A grade is given for each of the reviews. This is one of the ways we build a culture of constructive, useful feedback, as well as practice doing code reviews and mimic a real workplace environment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>During the time the students are working on the guides</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(as opposed to group work time) we offer coding sessions and online workshops, which are recorded and available for later use. &nbsp;Also, we help you with any problems you might encounter while you are working on the guides, through one-on-one calls, which is where the big learning happens. We take a look at what you&#39;ve been up to, help solve problems and point ways things could be done better. This is a hands-on course, most of the time is used for creating things.

The group project is presented to the teachers or in a seminar where people from the industry come and give feedback to the projects. Each participant receives an individual grade for the project based on the group&rsquo;s grade in combination with jafningjamat (another type of peer-evaluation system that helps to keep the grade fair since sometimes members cannot participate as much in the group work as others, for some reason).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The presentation seminars are scheduled to specific dates, and you will get the most out of the program if you keep up with them. </span><span>Since </span><span class="c3">the coding sessions and workshops are synchronized with the seminars, it is easier to form groups, most of the discussion in online meetings and between students are about the current topics etc. But since the classes are all recorded and the instructors are available, you can still continue with the course and even catch up if you need to go slower at some point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">After each module we have a &quot;retrospective meeting&quot; where everyone can share how things went and what could be improved. By imitating the process that software companies use to continuously improve their software, we are constantly improving our program.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You can see the study topics here: https://io.tskoli.dev/guides.</span></p></body></html>
